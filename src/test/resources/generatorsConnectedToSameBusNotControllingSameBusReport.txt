+ Test Report
   + Load flow on network 'sim1'
      + Network CC0 SC0
         Generators [GEN, GEN2] are connected to the same bus VLGEN_0 but control the voltage of different buses: VLGEN_0 (kept) and VLLOAD_0 (rejected)
         + Network info
            Network has 4 buses and 4 branches
            Network balance: active generation=608.0 MW, active load=600.0 MW, reactive generation=0.0 MVar, reactive load=200.0 MVar
            Angle reference bus: VLGEN_0
            Slack bus: VLGEN_0
         Outer loop AcHvdcAcEmulation
         Outer loop VoltageMonitoring
         AC load flow completed successfully (solverStatus=CONVERGED, outerloopStatus=STABLE)
