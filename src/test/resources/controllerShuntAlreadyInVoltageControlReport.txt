   + Load flow on network 'svc'
      + Network CC0 SC0
         Another shunt, vl3_0_controller_shunt_compensators, already controls the voltage at a different point on the same bus vl2_0. The second shunt is removed from the voltage control.
         + Network info
            Network has 3 buses and 2 branches
            Network balance: active generation=101.3664 MW, active load=101 MW, reactive generation=0 MVar, reactive load=150 MVar
            Angle reference bus: vl2_0
